DO NOT USE THIS FOR ACTUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY.
I am not a cryptographer, and I just wanted to get more familiar with JS and cryptography. This is an excecise for me and not a robust cryptographic library.
THERE ARE LIKLEY KEY SECURITY FLAWS.
Seriously, plesase don't use this to protect anything. It will fail.
